# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#     bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
#     bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload --drafts
#     bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload --drafts --host 0.0.0.0 ([Accessing a Jekyll site over your local wifi network](https://zarino.co.uk/post/jekyll-local-network/))
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!

# TODO- The below is added in response to the following error after updating to ruby 3- `cannot load such file -- webrick (LoadError)`. Below is the workaround suggested in [Load error: cannot load such file â€“ webrick](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/load-error-cannot-load-such-file-webrick/5417). Perform an audit to determine if this is necessary in the future.
